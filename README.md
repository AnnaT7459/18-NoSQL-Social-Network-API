# NoSQL Social Network API

## Description
If I were a social media startup, I would want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website could handle large amounts of unstructured data. I learned a lot about Mongoose models through this challenge and simplifying controllers and routes for easier readability. I worked with Insomnia more and gained more confidence with requests. I learned a lot about collections of documents and subdocuments while working on this challenge.

## Installation
You will need MongoDB and Insomnia. Packages will be installed by running npm install in the integrated terminal.

## Usage
With this API, you are able to see all users, find a single user, update users, have users add friends, as well as delete them as friends or as users. You can also see all of the user's thoughts and reactions. Those are also able to be updated, added, and deleted.
